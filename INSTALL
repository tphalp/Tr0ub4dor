**           w3pw - a web based password console.             **
**                       Version 1.41                         **
****************************************************************

**** THIS IS A MODIFIED VERSION!!! ******

The normal installation will NOT work because the database has been 
changed for this installation, and I have not yet included those
changes in the installation code.

So, you will need to manually create 2 tables.

Table main remains unchanged.

Table wallet remains unchanged.

Create table catmap with 2 fields:

  wid - primary key, auto_increment, int
  catid - int

CREATE TABLE `catmap` (
\n  `wid` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
\n  `catid` int(11) NOT NULL default '1',
\n  PRIMARY KEY  (`wid`)
\n) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 ;

Create table categories with 4 fields:

  catid - primary key, auto_increment, int
  catname - tinyblob
  catparent - int
  comment - tinyblob

CREATE TABLE `categories` (
\n  `catid` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
\n  `catname` tinyblob NOT NULL,
\n  `catparent` int(11) NOT NULL default '1',
\n  `comment` tinyblob NOT NULL,
\n  PRIMARY KEY  (`catid`)
\n) ENGINE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=23 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 ;

**** END OF CHANGES FOR MODIFIED VERSION!!! ******

For an update of a previous version, please refer to the "UPDATE" Chapter 
of this Document!

REQUIREMENTS:
=============
- A Webserver (w3pw was tested with Apache); for secure transfer, SSL is 
  strongly recommended.
- PHP with Mysql support enabled and mcrypt libraries.
  You can find the mcrypt libraries here for linux installations: 
  http://mcrypt.sourceforge.net/. 
  For a Windows installation, the required binaries can be downloaded from 
  http://ftp.emini.dk/pub/php/win32/mcrypt/.
- A Mysql Database.

INSTALLATION
============

Unpack the distribution packet:
	tar xzf w3pw-1.41.tgz

change to the directory w3pw-1.41

create a database called "w3pw" (or any other name): 
	mysql -u <your_mysql_user> -p -e "CREATE DATABASE w3pw"

import the database structure: 
	mysql -u <your_mysql_user> -p w3pw < w3pw.sql. If you use another 
	database name change the 
	first w3pw to your choosen DB-Name.

delete the w3pw.sql file (for security reasons)

set your password for accessing w3pw:
	mysql -u <your_mysql_user> -p w3pw -e "UPDATE main set \
	pw=SHA1(\"<yourpassword>\")"
	Standard Password that comes with the installation package 
	is "secret".
	
edit the file include/config.php
	change the variables $dbuser, $database, $hostname, $dbpasswd, $port
	and $tmppath to match your system values. 
	Windows Users: Don't use a backslash in the $tmppath variable. Instead
	use a simple slash "/".
	If you would like to set another timeout value, change the variable
	$session_timeout also. If you would like w3pw to generate a random 
	password if you create a new entry, change the variable 
	$random_pw_length to the desired password length. If you want't do 
	disable this feature, set this variable to 0.
	
copy the directory w3pw-1.40 to your webserver htdocs directory
	cp -r w3pw-1.40 /usr/local/httpd/htdocs

UPDATE
======

Follow all of the steps described in the section above, but be sure to create 
a NEW database and a NEW path. DO NOT OVERWRITE YOUR PREVIOUS INSTALLATION! 
Point the database variables in your new 1.41 installation to the new database!

Go to the new 1.41 directory in your webservers htdocs directory and rename the
file "_update.php" to "update.php".

Start the program in your webbrowser as described in the usage section below 
and follow the update instructions. After the succcessful import of your old 
database, delete the file "update.php" from your webservers directory.


USAGE
=====
Open your favorite webbrowser and access this URL: 

         https://127.0.0.1/w3pw/starter.html 

(Alternatively, use "http://..." if you prefer an unsecure communication).

A hint for Firefox Users: Firefox disables by default that Javascript can 
change the text of the status bar. w3pw has a built in counter for automatic 
logoffs if there is no user interaction after a specific amount of time. 
This feature by itself will work also with this option disabled, but you will 
see a counter on the statusbar if you allow Javascript to change the text on 
the statusbar.

Without Javascript, the automatic logoff feature will not work!
